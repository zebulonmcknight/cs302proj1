I compiled using :
	g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -o lib_info lib_info.cpp
This compilation command was taken from Dr.Planks Notes. 

Our group dynamics were pretty solid but unorganized due to it being the start
of the year. We ran into some issues with pushing to the repository, but ended
up with both of us contributing to helper functions and the main loop to
varying extents. We didn't code together because their wasn't a convenient time, 
but we still contributed relatively equally.
